        <p>
            My name is Oliver Cromwell. I am the Lord Protector of England.
            I rose to power as a result of the English Civil War by 
            overthrowing King Charles I. Oddly enough, my extremist religious
            views were seen as too harsh by my subjects and now they
            want to replace me with Charles II, Charles I's son. My life
            sucks.
